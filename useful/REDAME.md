Requirements:

- Objective: Develop a fall detection system aimed at improving eldercare safety, with an emphasis on real-time processing and accurate event detection.
- Algorithm Use: Employ YOLOv7 or YOLOv8 for accurate human figure identification and differentiation between normal activities and fall events. A keen interest in the ongoing evolution of these models is essential.
- Data Handling: Collect and augment video footage to cover a wide range of fall scenarios, incorporating multimodal data fusion techniques where applicable.
- Real-time Processing: Ensure the system operates with low latency, incorporating an alert mechanism for immediate notification (including event details) upon fall detection.
- User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for easy system interaction.
- Testing: Conduct extensive testing across real-world settings to validate system effectiveness.
- Privacy and Ethics: Implement stringent data protection measures, including obtaining informed consent.
- Hardware Integration: Facilitate smooth hardware integration for efficient system performance.
- Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for system deployment and maintenance.

Additionally, as I have previously mentioned, the field of multimodal data fusion is rapidly evolving, and it is crucial to stay abreast of the state-of-the-art developments with a critical eye. Comparative studies of individual modalities, such as those conducted by the Toronto team, are of particular interest. It may also be beneficial to familiarize oneself with recent approaches based on entity naming for human detection and the processing of bounding boxes for posture estimation, identifying the exact locations of bodily joints. This can further facilitate risk assessment for falls. Yolo and ViTPose are two tools recommended for use in this context, and I have included references for your review:
